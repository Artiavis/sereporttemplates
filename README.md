# LaTeX Project Repository

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a version
controlled repository for our project files.

## Contents

This repository should contain an /img/ folder for 
embedding images into our reports; a /tex/ folder
for allowing us to compose seperate chapters 
independently and then combine them later; and
then a whole bunch of random files dumped into the root.
