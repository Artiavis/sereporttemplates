\section{Economic and Mathematical Models}

% Here put a discussion of the various assumptions 
% and simplifications used by economists and mathematicians
% used to describe the financial markets IE microeconomic
% assumption that no one person has undue influence as long
% as we stipulate that he doesn't have too much money, but
% to make sure, we need to limit the money people can have.
% Cite one or two sources. 
%
% Also explain the bid/ask spread, or in other words, 
% why if Person A sells at $X.YZ, and Person A buys
% at $X.YZ, they could be paying a little more or less than
% they would have otherwise thought. Bla blah read about how
% the bid/ask spread works and explain that we make the 
% simplifying assumption that all purchases happen at the 
% ask price and all sales happen at the bid price. 
%
% Finally describe how even though Marsic described in his 
% email an algorithmic way of implementing Report Abuse
% functionality, we'll use a "binary" model ;)  because
% we wanted to focus on core features first and the model
% can be changed later at our discretion. 

% Just make it sound like it was a conscious decision to be 
% use simpler models.
