\section{Asynchronous Subsystems}
The nature of Order's requires a vary particular type of asynchronous handling.  Lucky for us we were able to find a ruby gem that makes this messy process quite elegant.  Resque allows one to queue up tasks and execute them in "first in first out"(FIFO) order by dequeueing the next enabled task in-line and performing it.  For our application we need to be able to wait before processing certain orders based on their dependencies and characteristics.  Rather then have a different data-type and handler for every type of order, we took the approach to consolidate all order types into a single order data-type that has a field that specifies the transactionType.  The orderHandler can be considered more of a wrapper function as it checks the transactionType of the order it is to perform and send it off to be handled uniquely based on the checked value.  While market orders, are executed almost immediately after being placed, stop and limit orders may not be executed for quite some time.  Whenever a task needs to be performed asynchronously, the task is entered into a designated portion of a Redis database, configured as a queue. Background "workers" (processes) perform tasks as they arrive. There are specifically two dedicated processes named Worker1 and Worker2, dedicated to order processing and UserSummary sending respectfully.  Worker two runs every 24 hours and is responsible for populating a list of one UserSummary task for each user. In order for the UserSummaryController to obtain all necessary information on user and league performance information.  The Performance Summarization objects are invoked to handle the retrieval of those specific stats, with the retrieval being handled by the DatabaseInterface object.
