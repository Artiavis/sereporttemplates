\chapter{Program Documentation}

Dario Rethage authored end-user documentation, included in the docs folder. Jeff Rabinowitz used RDoc to generate HTML pages of the technical documentations, compiled
from source code. It is also included in the docs folder. Finally, the README's for bootstrapping are, again, in the docs folder.
