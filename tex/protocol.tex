\section{Network Protocol}
Though it is not necessarily an interesting topic to discuss for our project, it is none the less important to take note of. Because Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the predominate communication protocol distributed throughout the internet, it is critical that our website relies on it to make requests and send information between our user and system. Really, there is no other option if we desire Capital Games to be successful. HTTP is already a strictly and well defined protocol; for a description, see \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol}{this reference.} \\
