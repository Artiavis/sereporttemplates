\chapter{Plan of Work}

% This chapter should include a Gantt chart for each our
% coding timelines for the first and second report and
% maybe even a second Gantt chart for our report deadlines
% from this report through May.
%
% Remember that we're trying to roll out core functionality 
% in time for the first demo, so try to include as much as 
% possible about creating users, leagues, basic settings (only),
% most trade and search things on the part for the first report,
% and the comments, reporting, adjusting settings, begin/end dates,
% privacy, mailing, whatever for the second. See our proposal for 
% the laundry list of features we actually said we'd be delivering.
%
% Also maybe talk about "Project Ownership", since he's big 
% on that.
