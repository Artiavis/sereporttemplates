\section{Activity Coordination}
Most group activity coordination was done either through a Facebook Group including all members of the group or by SMS text via a smart phone application called "GroupMe." We coordinated assignments for each group member based on their skills and/or volunteering to take responsibility for a certain aspect of the project. Typically, Jeff Adler took on the lower level server-side responsibilities, Eric Cuiffo took on broadly implementing the user interface, Val Red adapted external modules for our website (such as the news feed and financial data from Yahoo!), Jeff Rabinowitz fleshed out the database and underlying structure/configuration of the website, Dario Rethage developed and implemented the logic and forms for transactions, and Nick Palumbo on tying individual elements together--such as plugging in Yahoo! Finance or Highcharts for UI. In order to ensure our code was managed and merged smoothly, we used a Git repository, which is a form of version control. It features simple public or private file management for any number of users, automatic merging, issue generation, and other features, making it incredibly useful for our purposes.

\section{Organizing Meetings}
Meetings were predominantly organized by Nick Palumbo and Jeff Rabinowitz. We met mostly at the Hill Center's iLabs. Meeting times and responsibilities were designated or confirmed through either Facebook or GroupMe, and both proved very effective. In general, meetings were scheduled weekly (typically on Mondays) to discuss and divide responsibilities. In this way, we were able to keep everyone up-to-date on what was expected on them and to meet deadlines with regularity. In case that someone was unable to make one of the meetings, Val Red kept minutes of each meeting to keep everyone current on what was discussed. Much of our coding and report work was facilitated during these meetings, and the meetings typically resulted in our most productive cycles of work as we were able to motivate one another in an in-person environment. All in all, our meetings were easy to coordinate, went smoothly, and were very successful.
