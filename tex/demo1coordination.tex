\section{Activity Coordination}

Most group activity coordination was done either electronically, online, through a Facebook Group including all members of the group or by SMS text via this Smartphone Application called "GroupMe." Meeting times and responsibilities were designated or confirmed through either of these means. Both proved very effective. We were able to collect all 6 members weekly for meetings to discuss and divide the work that needed to be done for the upcoming week.

\section{Organizing Meetings}

Meetings were predominantly organized on Mondays. We met mostly at the Hill Center's iLab's. Much of our coding and report work was facilitated during these meetings, and the meetings typically resulted in our most productive cycles of work.
