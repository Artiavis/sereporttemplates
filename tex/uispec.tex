\section{Preliminary Design}

The user interface of CapitalGames emphasizes easy to understand graphical representations of financial metrics pertaining to various aspects of trading and the economy in general. In addition, color harmony and adequate space distribution is a priority to provide a pleasant user experience. A UI design built on top of the responsive Bootstrap UI framework was chosen due to its extensive support for many UI components needed in the application. The center of the CapitalGames experience is the dashboard where a user can quickly see an overview of his/her performance in all leagues, join new leagues and learn more about finance. Each primary view is presented below with particular attention having been put into a consistant and uniform user experience. Each view is annotated with applicable use cases so that a sequence of views can be determined for each use case.\\
