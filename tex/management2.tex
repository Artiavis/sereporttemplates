\section{Report Coordination}
\subsection{Breaking Up The Report}
As every group member is working on our project, it was important to ensure that every group member also worked on the report. However, it can be difficult to dole out responsibilities on something like this while ensuring fairness in terms of amount of research and work required. It seemed natural to divide up the the report based on each of our group member's strengths and the piece of our application that they would actually be working on themselves--that is, if a group member would be more responsible for front end aspects of our website, they should be the one to write about user interface specification. Such a division should allow for the highest quality of discussion on each aspect of specification in our report. Thus, we decided on the following break up for system specifications: \\
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Jeff Rabinowitz} - Jeff, being most familiar with finance and having broad general knowledge on software systems, took responsibility for defining things usch as customer requirements and system architecture.}
\item{\textbf{Nick Palumbo} - Nick's skills lie in programming and team management, and, as such, he took responsibility for detailing functional requirements and project management.}
\item{\textbf{Eric Cuiffo} - Eric is a talented designer and took responsibility for describing our user interface specification and design, including creating mock-ups and ease of use discussion.}
\item{\textbf{Dario Rethage} - Dario has worked intensively on website development before and also has a knack for design, so he helped Eric with user interface design along with defining our plan of work and describing project coordination.}
\item{\textbf{Val Red} - Val, good with databases and other ways of a system interfacing with external sources, was given the role of discussing our domain and class models for our system.}
\item{\textbf{Jeff Adler} - Jeff knows the nitty-gritty, low-level aspects of system and software development and was responsible for discussing subsystems and test design.}
\end{itemize}
It's important to note that this does not perfectly represent each members contributions, and that many sections had overlapping of team members. Sections that involved mock-ups and diagrams in particular were developed by several members overseen by the people given the responsibility as stated above. Pieces of the report not mentioned above were worked on by multiple or all of our members. The exact breakdown of contributions is given below in the section "Report 2 Contributions". \\

\subsection{Compiling The Report}
In order to ensure consistency, various venues of communication were opened: a group forum, group MMS, and collaborative online documents. Each member was asked to continually update the group on their progress and a synposis on the discussion they were including. Thus, the contributions of the members could be policed. In general, Jeff Rabinowitz and Nick Palumbo were responsible for ensuring everyone was doing their share of the work and that deadlines were being met. However, no decisions were made without the consent of the group; it was just necessary to have someone to make sure everything was running smoothly. Nick typically divided up labor and set deadlines, and Jeff kept an open dialogue with each member on their progress. \\

A single styling document was created which defined formatting standards (color, spacing, font, etc.) across the entire document and applied to each piece of the report, which guaranteed that all these aspects were held constant throughout. For each report submission: with enough time in advance of the deadline, each member submitted their piece of the report and Jeff Rabinowitz, being the group expert on Latex (used to create this report), proofread their formatting and syntax to ensure no compiling errors and consistency. He then submitted the final report to Nick who looked over the report to confirm the quality of each member's work and to ensure completeness of all topics covered. Each group member was responsible for the completeness of their own sections and would be notified of any deficiencies. Ultimately, Nick submitted the finalized report to the Sakai drop box. \\

\subsection{Issues}
Each group member was asked to explain their experience on the coordination of the report, any praise or criticism they had for the fellow members, and any issues that were encountered:

\subsubsection{Nick Palumbo}
In general, I was satisfied with the coordination of our group. The only concern was that we occasionally struggled with deadlines. As only Jeff Rabinowitz was familiar with Latex, we often dealt with compilation issues bringing us right up to the final hour on our first report submissions. Over time, as we became familiar with the language, this problem lessened. Though, even for the second report, Dario and Jeff Adler had still not quite familiarized themselves with Latex, and this caused a small panic for our submission right before the deadline. However, Jeff Rabinowitz was able to work through the issue, and things worked out fine. I feel that, on the whole, each group member adequately contributed to the report, and I feel that all issues we dealt with were relatively minor.\\

Something else! Something else! \\

\subsubsection{Val Red}
It has been a great experience working with Team 2 thus far. Everyone is competent in programming and communicating with the group; everyone pulled their weight up to this point in the project. In spite of Ruby on Rails actually being new to all but 16.67% of us, we have done an exceptional job applying our experience and proficiency in programming as a whole to overcome that hurdle and plan for adapting Ruby on Rails for Capital Games. We have a great, fair distribution scheme for reports that enabled us to pair up and tackle even portions of the report, and I've been very compatible working with Eric Cuiffo on our parts. We work great together and have definitely put an honest day's work in. Overall, I am more than satisfied with our work thus far and am definitely excited to push ahead to continue working on Capital Games with Team 2.\\

\subsubsection{Eric Cuiffo} 
I've had a great time working with everyone on the team. Each person has a set of skills that empower the group and complement skills that others lack. Jeff Rabinowitz works harder than anyone I've ever met and can do pretty much anything if he wants to. Nick Palumbo is a great leader who can make decisions with ease and is super reliable. Jeff Adler is very knowledgeable about server-side programming, can do pretty much anything with it, and can communicate descriptions of each step very well. Dario Rethage is also very knowledgeable of web applications and takes charge with ease. Val Red, who I've worked most closely with, is a great group worker and has the skillset of a guru all around for this project. All around a great team to work with and our hard work will stand out in the end.\\
