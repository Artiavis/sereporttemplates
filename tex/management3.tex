\section{History of Work}

Throughout the semester we completed several of our planned milestones in a punctual,
 thorough, and consistent manner.

Our first planned milestone, completing the Report 1 Part 1 prior to 12 February 2013, 
was met on time. We continued to meet our report deadlines 
for Report 1 Part 2 and the full, compiled Report 1 by 
18 February 2013 and 22 February 2013, respectively. 
For the second report, we successfully met our deadlines for Report 2 Part 1 
(consisting of Sequence Diagrams, timing and communication diagrams) 
and Report 2 Part 2 (consisting of Class Diagrams, Interface, Architecture 
design, data structures, UI, tests and implementations) 
on 1 March 2013 and 8 March 2013, respectively.

As we met our initial Report deadlines, we also simultaneously 
began work on the initial build of \textit{Capital Games}. We began with 
deploying our server environment, which took place between 22 February 
and 2 March 2013. While we were initially weighing our options between 
dedicated virtual private server (VPS) and Heroku, we determined that 
a dedicated virtual private server would better suit our needs and we 
successfully deployed it by 2 March 2013. In this time, we also finalized 
our plan for mockup-based views and the CSS/HTML plan. 

Populating the server with Ruby on Rails and Gem plugins, however, 
took a little longer than anticipated. This is because we needed to 
confirm and test for full compatibility between our server's Ubuntu 
operating system, Debian 6 ``Squeeze'' before deploying Ruby on 
Rails and begin programming on it. This extended beyond our initial 
range of 1 March 2013 to 8 March 2013 and was completed by 13 March 2013.

We completed our full Report 2 deadline by 17 March 2013. After this point 
we shifted gears and committed to having \textit{Capital Games} Alpha build 
prepared for our demo. In the weeks between 17 March 2013 and 2 April 2013 
we met several of our objectives. The Yahoo! Finance API was implemented, 
the MySQL database structure was deployed and populated. Our routing plan 
was completed, our views (webpage layouts via the ``Dashboard Admin'' theme) 
were implemented, and we successfully got users, leagues, and portfolios 
at a working state in which data could be utilized between them in our 
routing structure. We even had our graphs via Highcharts and responsive
UI at a working state! Thus we met our 2 April 2013 deadline and were able 
to present Demo 1 with a stable, presentable, and functional Alpha build. 

Our biggest strength was establishing manageable goals that still built on 
the strengths and failures of our predecessors. We chose a superior UI but 
were not overly-ambitious with functionality, otherwise; 
this enabled us to meet our goals in a punctual manner. We almost fully 
implemented our orders system, in addition, so we were actually ahead of 
our initial goals for our \textit{Capital Games} Alpha build!

\section{Current Status}

Currently, \textit{Capital Games} is a functioning Rails application. We have an 
online version of our latest builds on the domain http://capitalgam.es/ based on 
our Virtual Private server. It features working orders, leagues, portfolios, and 
user systems with a fully-functional and responsive UI that can be used in tablets 
and phones in addition to personal computer to be user friendly for anyone on a 
smart device. Most core functionalities have been deployed and the current status is 
debugging and optimizing our website to address orders in an asynchronous fashion 
to maximize the efficiency of our application. 

\section{Key Accomplishments}

\textit{Capital Games} unlocked the following achievements:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{A Ruby on Rails-based Framework for core Web Application functionality}
	\item{A responsive UI usable on smart devices based on the ``Dashboard Admin'' theme.}
	\item{A minimalistic and easy-to-use system for users, portfolios, and leagues}
	\item{A research page that draws news feeds pertinent to investment options}
	\item{An implementation of highcharts that presentably showed candlestick and line-graph data }
\end{itemize}

\textit{Capital Games} also deployed the following use cases:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Buy Stock}
	\item{Sell Stock}
	\item{Query Stock}
	\item{View History}
	\item{View Portfolio}
	\item{Register}
	\item{Create League}
	\item{Submit Comment}
	\item{Join League}
	\item{Change League Settings}
	\item{Browse Companies}
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

The final stretch for a release-build \textit{Capital Games} would be an immersive tutorial 
system activating upon user registration. This would have extensively took advantage of AJAX 
and our Rails framework but also is the most complex type of functionality to deploy on a live 
version of \textit{Capital Games}, hence it would have required careful, slow, and 
surgical-level development. This was one of our major post-demonstration goals, but the 
level of sophistication for a fully-functional live tutorial upon user registration was 
highly impractical for the remaining time we had.

We also would like to perfect our asynchronous processing system for orders so that 
the stop and short options would work as true-to-life as possible. This was also one of our 
major post-demo goals, and while this is one of the major portions of our final demo updates, 
there are many more efficient practices in the field of asynchronous processing systems that 
would be able to expand our \textit{Capital Games} long after we complete our final 
demonstration build. 

While we intended to implement a full Reporting and Disciplinary functionality within a Site 
Administration suite, development on this fell in favor of the core functionality and orders, 
which required a lot more dedicated manpower and hours than anticipated with the problems of 
asynchronous processing as well as communicating with the Yahoo! Finance API and the 
Highcharts implementation.   

Finally, to maximize user retention, another future work goal would have been to implement
 social media and e-mail notification options so users can be reminded to check and update their portfolios and leagues on a regular basis. A mailer system was intended, however, 
 development on that particular item fell in favor of on-site notification and chat options, 
 which were fully implemented by the Alpha into final demo release.  

Our Rails framework for \textit{Capital Games} was deployed so well, however, that it's 
expandability lends itself to a swift transition to these Future Work goals!
