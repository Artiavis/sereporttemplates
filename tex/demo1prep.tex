\chapter{Brochures \& Slides Preparation}

All members contributed to the writing, publishing and distribution of brochures. A copy is attached in the following pages. 

Slides were prepared by Val A. Red on Microsoft Powerpoint based on input by Jeff Rabinowitz. These slides are also attached in the following pages. Images were obtained over the internet and photoshpped to make the presentation look professional; an image of Professor Marsic included among them in the slide explaining who "Capital Games" is for in order to stress how universally approachable our web application is supposed to be. Essentially, for the powerpoint, we focused on the educational and responsive aspects of Capital Games to make our audience more familiar with what makes our web application a unique and attractive option.
