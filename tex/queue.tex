\section{Asynchronous Processing Subsystem}

% Alright, this section requires a solid
% 2-3 pages explaining EVERYTHING LIKE 
% I'M FIVE YEARS OLD. You can't just be like
% "this is how you subsystem". That's what 
% Caggiano does and it's not good enough.
% You need to be like Yates and explain
% everything about the system before you explain
% how to use it. You should explain what a queue
% is, why we chose it (it was the best way to scale
% our load and handle conditional orders), how it's used,
% in what format things are requested and returned
% Then explain how Resque/worker threads abstracts that.
% Then explain the types of methods/classes/jobs you
% created and why they were created. LIKE I'M FIVE!!!
% Then explain how the application interfaces with 
% the subsystem and why I don't need to know your
% subsystem inside and out in order to call into it.
% ONLY THEN can you include diagrams. AND THEN 
% EXPLAIN THEM. People care more about the how and why
% than the what, because from one they should be able
% to intuit the other.
